# <div align='center'> ðŸ¦¾ Using Machine Learning to Predict Concrete Strength: Kaggle Playground ðŸ¦¾ </div>
### Overview
The objective of this project is to start getting using Machine Learning. I used various types of machine learning algorithms, from a simple linear regression model in Scikit-learn to using TensorFlow. This was my first big dive into machine learning so I tried to explain what I was doing in the Jupyter notebook. This notebook earned me a top 24% spot on Kaggle.

### Prerequisites
To fully understand the process and the concepts used for this project, I would recommend having a good understanding of:
- Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- The Python Libraries Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Other Machine Learning Algorithms like XGBoost, Catboost, LightGBM
